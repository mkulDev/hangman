Hangman Game by mkul is a simple web-based game where players can try to guess the name of a European capital city by selecting letters. The game provides a fun and challenging way to test your knowledge of European capitals.


## How to Play
Click the "Play" button on the welcome screen to start the game.
You will be presented with a series of underscores representing the letters of a European capital city.
Use your keyboard or mouse to select letters you think are in the name of the city.
If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in its correct position(s) in the city name.
If you guess an incorrect letter, a part of the hangman image will be revealed, and you will hear a sound effect.
Try to guess the city's name before the hangman is fully revealed to win the game.
If you make five incorrect guesses, you lose the game.
After winning or losing, you can choose to play again.

The game randomly selects a European capital city from a predefined list.
You have a maximum of five incorrect guesses before losing the game.
